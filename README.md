### ‚ú® Project Description

The objective of this project is to create a suite of plugins/parsers for [Volatility 3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3) for docker memory forensics.
We want to submit this project to Volatility Plugin Contest 2021

    - `docker ps`
    - `docker diff`
    - `docker port`
    - `docker log`
    - And so on...
